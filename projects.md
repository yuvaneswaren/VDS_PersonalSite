# Projects  

## 🛫 Learning-Based Flight Delay Prediction  
Built a predictive system that turns messy airline data into actionable insights.  
I experimented with machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and deep learning models (DNN, CNN, CRNN) to uncover **why and when flights are likely to be delayed** — factoring in weather, carriers, and departure times.  
**Result:** Discovered key delay patterns that could improve scheduling and passenger communication.

## 😀 Facial Expression Recognition with DeRL  
Explored how AI can “read between the lines” — literally.  
I used a Conditional GAN with a U-Net generator to **remove facial expressions** from images (de-expression) and then taught the model to classify subtle emotional states.  
**Why it matters:** Better expression recognition can improve healthcare tools for monitoring patient well-being or human-robot interaction.

## 🔍 FotoFind: Intelligent Image Retrieval  
Ever wanted Google-like search for your own image collection?  
I built a **multi-modal image search engine** combining object detection (YOLO, Faster-RCNN), vision-language models (ViT-GPT2, BLIP), and OCR.  
- <0.4 second query response  
- 90%+ accuracy on large datasets  
- Robust to edge cases using synthetic images generated via DALL·E & Stable Diffusion  
**Tech:** Flask API, MySQL, Python, OpenCV — scalable and production-ready.

## 🎙️ VocaList: Voice-Activated Task Manager  
Designed a voice-controlled to-do list and reminder system that turns natural language commands into scheduled actions.  
- Powered by React front-end + Python back-end  
- Integrated an LLM to interpret commands and manage tasks  
**Goal:** Make productivity tools more accessible and truly hands-free.
