# About Me  

Hey there 👋. I’m **Yuvaneswaren**, a curious mind currently diving deep into **Computer Science at UIC**.  
I love turning messy data into something meaningful, and building AI systems that actually solve real problems.  

I’ve gone from exploring cybersecurity in undergrad to engineering data pipelines at **Chargebee**, to now crafting projects that span **computer vision, machine learning, and automation**.  
Whether it’s predicting flight delays, teaching a model to read faces, or designing a lightning-fast image search system, I enjoy the challenge of taking an idea from *concept* to *working solution*.  

</br>

Outside the code editor, you’ll find me geeking out over new research papers, tinkering with model architectures, or brainstorming ways to make tech more human-centered.  

</br>

If any of that sounds exciting, let’s connect!!! I’m always up for a good conversation or collaboration.
