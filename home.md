# About me
My name is Jegadit S Saravanan, and I am a MS CS student at UIC. I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore.

</br>

I used to be really into cybersecurity, but I’ve since shifted my focus to Computer Vision for healthcare & robotics. I am also intersted in AI/ML, & computation optimization as well.

</br>

I am always eager to explore new technologies & concepts. Throughout my academic journey & professional experiences, I’ve consistently sought opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems, pushing the boundaries & delivering impactful solutions.
